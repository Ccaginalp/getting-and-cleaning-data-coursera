# Course Project for "Getting and Cleaning Data" on Coursera

This is my repo for the course project. The included R program does the following:

1. Load activity, feature info.
2. Load training and test datasets.
3. Keep only desired features, i.e. mean or standard deviations.
4. Loads activity/subject data and joins these to the datasets.
5. Merges everything into one dataset.
6. Outputs a tidy dataset consisting of the mean for each subject-activity pair.
